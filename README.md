## About this project

Welcome to the CloudSOE project - we're developing a community-driven, cloud-native, multi-platform Standard Operating Environment (SOE) for organisations that adopt Information Security Manual ([ISM](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/ism)) guidelines when building information systems that use Virtual Machines.

The project uses a collection of cloud-native technologies to achieve desired outcomes for Azure (and in future, on-premises & multi-cloud) IaaS systems:

- Azure Image Builder
- Azure Policy & Guest Configuration
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Automation

The example code in this repository should be considered a functional prototype which you can learn from and apply in your own sandpit subscriptions.

## Getting started

Please see [getting started](https://aka.ms/cloudsoe/#/?id=getting-started) section of the docs for instructions on getting started

## Roadmap
We hope that future development of the CloudSOE project will be ✨community-driven✨. We can think of a number of enhancements that would improve the utility of the solution, such as:

- Simplify the setup process
- Test/build Azure Arc for on-premises and other cloud management
- Add Linux support
- Move to policy-based setting enforcement (i.e. not just audit)
- ESLZ integration
- Bicep Refactoring
- Review and implement delta guidelines since November 2020 ISM
